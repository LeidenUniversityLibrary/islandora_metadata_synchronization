ubl_batch_purge_items
===========================

Batch purge items

This module does two things:

 -  it adds a way to delete/purge all items of a specific content model
    from a collection

 -  adds a 'purge all items'-action to the batch queue set of Islandora.
    In this way, one can easily delete an import action that has gone awry.
